# Employee-Salary-Prediction

This project was developed as a part of the **AICTE Edunet IBM SkillsBuild Internship** program. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee's salary is more than \$50K per year based on various demographic and professional attributes using the **Adult Census Income Dataset**.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository - [Adult Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)
- **File used**: `adult 3.csv`
- The dataset includes features like age, education, occupation, relationship, hours-per-week, and more.

## 🚀 Objective

To classify individuals into two salary groups (`<=50K` and `>50K`) using supervised machine learning algorithms by analyzing demographic data.

## 🧠 Technologies and Tools

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📌 Features Used

- Age  
- Workclass  
- Education  
- Marital Status  
- Occupation  
- Relationship  
- Race  
- Gender  
- Capital Gain/Loss  
- Hours-per-week  
- Native Country  

## 📈 Machine Learning Models

The following models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

**Evaluation metrics used:**

- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report  

## 📊 Results

- The models were compared based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- The best-performing model was selected for final predictions.
